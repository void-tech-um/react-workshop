# React Workshop

This is the project for the React Workshop. Feel free to look over it to remind yourself of the concepts we covered.

You can find the detailed setup in the [docs](./docs/README.md) folder. Or you can go to the [live site](https://voidtechmichigan.com/react-workshop/).

## Quick Start

Install the dependencies:

```console
$ ./install solution
```

Run the development server:

```console
$ cd solution/
$ npm start
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

This script will populate the database with some hardcoded data. You can run it as many times as you want, but it will have duplicate data.

```

This script will install the dependencies for the project in the specified directory.
